The idea behind this project is simple. You mention the Twitter account (@TBD) underneath a tweet you suspect has been stolen, and the account will respond to tell you whether or not this tweet has been stolen, and, if so, how many times it's been tweeted.

After the initial setup, I may set up some sort of functionality that'll check to see if this has been altered slightly from some other tweet.
